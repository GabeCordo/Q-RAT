## Q
Q is a Remote-Access-Tool for controlling, monitoring or zombifying a target machine. Developed for educational purposes in the c language, it is intended for windows-machines controlled by unix servers. The software developed was a result of combining and putting into practice content learned within this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-undetectable-malware-using-c-language-ethical-hacking/) and the application of pre-known concepts to develop the backdoor.

### Use Cases?

While there are elements of this R.A.T that are a little unsavoury to the public-eye, many companies (specifically IT departments) require quick-access to machines for remote-work and patches. Furthermore, many companies wish to monitor employee-activity which is possible through Bomb20's built-in keylogger and sniffer.
